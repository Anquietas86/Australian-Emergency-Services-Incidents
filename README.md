# Australian Emergency Services Incidents

> **Stable release: v0.1.16** – SA C0S/SES incidents as **GeoLocation** entities for Home Assistant.

This custom integration pulls live incident data for **South Australia (CFS/SES)** and displays them on the Home Assistant map via the `geo_location` platform.

**Note:** The internal domain remains **`aus_emergency`** to preserve existing entity IDs. The project name uses the broader *Australian Emergency Services Incidents* as a foundation for future states (NSW, VIC, QLD, etc.).
